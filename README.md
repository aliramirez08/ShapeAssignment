# Shape Assignment

This project demonstrates the use of abstract classes and inheritance in Java by implementing shapes: `Sphere`, `Cylinder`, and `Cone`.

## ðŸ’» Java Source Code

### `Shape.java`
Defines the abstract base class `Shape` with abstract methods `surface_area()` and `volume()`.

---

### `Sphere.java`
Extends `Shape` and overrides the surface area and volume calculations for a sphere.

---

### `Cylinder.java`
Extends `Shape` and implements the calculations for a cylinder.

---

### `Cone.java`
Extends `Shape` and implements the surface area and volume for a cone.

---

### `ShapeArray.java`
The **driver class**: creates instances of all shapes, stores them in an array, and prints their computed values.
